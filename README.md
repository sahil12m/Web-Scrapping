# Web-Scrapping
This repo consists of a web-scrapping code from a website.
The century21.ipynb file consists of the code. 
The code extracts data statistics from "http://www.pyclass.com/real-estate/rock-springs-wy/LCWYROCKSPRINGS/" and stores it in a dataframe which finally is converted to the output.csv file.
